"""I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects. But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.
The positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas.""",Birth Control,Lybrel

I&#039;m your typical 18 year old lad and have never written on a forum before but I want to write something for the people that are worried about taking this (in my opinion) miracle drug. I am coming to the end of my 6 month course and I can honestly say it&#039;s been life changing. 

Before I started Roaccutane, I was fairly depressed and seriously lacking confidence due to my appearance. But after months of failed treatments on various antibiotics, I was referred to a dermatologist who instantly said there&#039;s only one way to fix my acne problem, Roaccutane. At first I thought this is the worst case scenario and I&#039;m going to be even more depressed as a result of the possible mental health side affects. Depression has run in my family so I was very worried. However, living like with acne wasn&#039;t something I was prepared to do, so I started the course on 40mg a day.

The first week I had a headache daily, but thankfully these die off after a week and paracetamol and ibuprofen will take all the pain away. Almost immediately, my lips were cracking and from then on in, I never went anywhere without some Carmex lip balm in my pocket.

As the first 3 months went by, I was still breaking out and was starting to think it isn&#039;t going to work. However, I&#039;m so glad I stuck with it because now I haven&#039;t got a single spot of my face and the scars have faded to the point where you can barely see them! After the third month, my derm upped my dose and I started to take 60mg a day. 

Luckily for me I hadn&#039;t had any serious side affects. Just your occasional nose bleed and dry skin, and sometimes my eyes were a bit blurry but it&#039;s not much of an issue.

Anyway, I just want anyone reading this that is worried about starting this medication, that not everyone has a horror story about Roaccutane and I couldn&#039;t be happier at how it&#039;s made me feel!!

"""Hi everyone, my name is Emma . I would just like to tell people my story of having the Implanon and the side effects I have experienced during this time. I got my first implant 7 years ago.
My experiences with the implant have been awful! And this is the reason I would like to give people an idea of what it can do to your body to hopefully help people deciding whether the implant is for them or if people are experiencing symptoms like the ones I had, then it is most likely due to the implant and the doctors really don&#039;t have a clue, as I was told by my GP on several occasions &quot;no it will not be the implant that is causing this, when in reality I knew it was&quot; and when I had it removed it confirmed that I was right. So here is my story.. 

With the implant I gained so much weight which I have been unable to loose.

I bled heavily during sex and when I say heavily I mean it went everywhere!! And this was on every occasion during intercourse and when I explained to my GP, in her head there was no way it was the implant! And this was when I was not bleeding, which wasn&#039;t very often.. this really does affect your life, your sex life, and your relationships. 

I bled almost all the time without a break, which makes you feel so uncomfortable and self conscious. I never had clean knickers!! I know, not nice. 

My hormones have been everywhere since I I got the implant also  depression, anxiety etc. 

Pain during Intercourse was a big issue while on the implant. I had so much pain that sometimes I could not have sex with my partner. Sometimes I would not lubricate myself which was also another symptom. Gp did not help with this either, apart from offer me lubricant!! 

If I was not bleeding, I had dark browny discharge. Until having the implant removed I cannot remember the last time I wore white knickers.

There are so much more but these are the main symptoms I have experienced more recently. I had my implant removed on the 6/11/17 and when having it removed I was intimidated by the nurse who was removing it, she was very rude!! Anyway.. I stopped bleeding straight away. I started my period on the 10/11/17. Which lasted 4-5 days. I have never bled since, not even a spot!! Me and my partner can finally enjoy intercourse without the worry about me bleeding, or being sore. I can even wear WHITE knickers now and they stay WHITE!!!! ITS AMAZING!! I have never felt so happy! I was starting to doubt my body while on the implant. I thought, my body isn&#039;t normal, there&#039;s something wrong with me, at one point I thought I had cervical cancer due the the bleeding during sex. My whole life has changed since having the implant removed, I feel so much better and back to normal, whatever normal is.. 

I really hope that by sharing my experience, if I can even help one person I will be happy☺️. Thank you for reading and if anyone would like to write to me in regards to this feel free to do so. Thank you.""",Birth Control,Implanon

I am writing both as a user and a person seeking additional information on Seroquel XR. I have been on it for about three months. I have found that it eliminated the manic phase of my diagnosis, as well as anxiety. However, tapering back and forth due to side effects has made it difficult to make consistent observations and I have suffered depression and even suicidality as a result. What have others experienced on this topic? I understand bipolar disorder is a multifaceted illness and therefore should be treated from both angles. Are most of you on more than one medication in conjunction with seroquel? I understand I have also had a difficult time taking it as prescribed and this may have hindered my results.

I gained 10lbs for every 10mg of Paxil I took for a total of 40lbs gained slowly over years.  Also, erectile disfunction became a problem. Finally, about 2 years ago, because of insurance change, I had to change psychiatrists. My new psychiatrist asked me if I had noticed side effects of weight gain and sexual dysfunction while on  Paxil. I had no idea my weight gain was related to Paxil. He weaned me off Paxil an on to Prozac. I lost 40 lbs in 6 mos without trying. Prozac works  just as well with my anxiety.

My menstrual cycle changed enormously. I&#039;m used to it now, but in the beginning, it was scary. My periods last four weeks on, four weeks off, and they are fairly heavy. They start out light, but get ferocious by the second week before tapering off to nothing. And the cramping....oh, the cramping.

The only downside is that SSRIs can cause hypothyroidism, so I am now also on thyroid medication. I went undiagnosed for years because the thyroid test ranges are so broad. I never had a thyroid problem before I started anti-depressants.

Still, the trade off is worth it because without the antidepressants I&#039;d be dead.

It was &quot;one of the most difficult &amp; Complicated IUD insertions I&#039;ve had in a very long time&quot; quoting the words of my Gynecologist MD. Now I have not been sexually active for over a year and a half (by choice) &amp; I&#039;ve never had kids so that for one was a concern for my doctor since she said i might be very tight &amp; feel pain. Anywhom I am 23 and recently decided to date again &amp; wanted to have a convinient birth control that won&#039;t affect my weight or cause acne since acne has recently been a new battle for me, so my first step was hitting the Internet for options. After reading many reviews for multiple birth controls I decided on the copper para guard which is for 10-12 years. Now I went to my doctor and had a screening for STDs &amp; HIV which is protocol to any birth control procedure. Then pregnancy tests were taken a few days before the insertion and the day of the insertion, after everything came out negative I was ready for my IUD. I was schedule to go in on Tuesday September 1, 2015 so I went in with anticipation of pain and I was very nervous. Mostly because it was something new for me to have a speculum inside me since I just had my first Pap smear ,ever, two weeks prior to the IUD insertion. As my doctor placed the speculum I had some discomfort, she had trouble finding my cervix, after some time she had everything positioned right and began to try and dilate my cervix, right when she started I began to feel extreme cramping. My doctor could not get her tool that she used to dilate my cervix to stay in, I was too tight due to the fact that I&#039;ve never had kids so it wasn&#039;t easy, my cervix kept pushing the prob out. She attempted a few more times until I couldn&#039;t take the pain anymore because the cramping became so severe I began to cry. Now I know i sound ridiculous crying but I have a pretty high tolerance for pain &amp; I never understood how many woman couldn&#039;t take the cramping they had when on their period because I don&#039;t experience cramping on my periods, at least until now. I now have so much more sympathy for those who do have this pain every month. My doctor gave me other birth control options because she wasn&#039;t successful in Inserting the IUD but she knew I didn&#039;t want others so she offered to use an anesthetic on my cervix to help with the insertion (which is not normally a part of the procedure but since I had a special case she offered this option to me). I was not happy with the fact that I had to have a needle inserted in my cervix but this was the birth control I wanted and I was going to do whatever to get it. I was in too much pain that day so I had to come back the next morning. So here I go Wednesday morning into my doctors office, laying down ready to get a needle inserted into my cervix which terrified me because I already knew how painful it was but I didn&#039;t feel a thing when she put the anesthetic, I was told I would feel a slight sting and some burning sensation but I didn&#039;t feel anything. It took her about 15 min to position the IUD correctly, she had to dilate me 8cm to get a good view and make sure I had a successful insertion. I felt NOTHING &amp; then she was done. Right after she had me lay down for a few minutes then had me slowly sit up, I felt like I was going to faint, The MD said my eyes were not focusing on her and I was so pale. At that point my whole face and hands where numb. She stayed there with me until I regained full blood flow to my upper body. FYI my doctor said some woman actually faint after the procedure &amp; in some rare cases they even have seizure because the pain of dilating the cervix is so intense. I was lucky of not having any cramps because my cervix was numb. 8 hrs later the numbness began to fade &amp; the pain started, I got prescribed 600 Tylenol which helped a little. I spotted the next 3 days, I had to use pantie liners. Then my period came 1 week early just 4 days after I got my IUD placed, it was very heavy the first 3 days with medium cramping and my period lasted 5 1/2 days. My usual periods post the IUD was 4 days with only 1 heavy day. I have now had my IUD going on 3 weeks and I have little spotting every day so I use liners all the time. Now the part that I was most nervous about was the whole &quot;me checking if I can feel the IUD strings&quot; Its something I&#039;m a bit uncomfortable doing mostly because I&#039;ve never done it before so the first couple of times I tried to check for the strings I couldn&#039;t feel anything so I began to freak out and rushed to my doctors office after my unsuccessful attempts. She said to wait until my first period was over and then to try again. I tried again after my period and I still couldn&#039;t feel anything then I found a way to check that best fits me since I have small hands so I&#039;ll share my wisdom with you guys lol. I check in the shower every morning I lift one leg as if I&#039;m going to shave then I insert my pointer and I squat a little which helps and I&#039;m able to feel the tip of the strings. I have not had any cramping since my period and my discharge has reduced. I&#039;m very happy with my IUD &amp; I plan on using it safely and responsibly as I have heard many woman have got pregnant with the IUD. I still plan on using condoms because of STDs and I got the IUD as a backup just in case. I plan on keeping it for the full 10 year unless there are any complications. Sorry for the long story but I for one would have loved to hear the entire experience someone had so I decided to share mine. Hope it helps at least one person :)""",Birth Control,Copper

As my MD warned, the anxiety initially increases, so keep the Xanax handy. Two weeks into it I started having longer and longer periods of normalcy. Then, on week three it&#039;s like it suddenly stopped and sent me into a tailspin right back to where I started from. My Pscyh told me to go to 20mg because I didn&#039;t have quite enough.
